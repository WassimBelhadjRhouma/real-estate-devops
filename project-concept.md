# Project Concept: Real Estate Web App with DevOps Practices

## Project Summary

This project applies DevOps principles to a full-stack real estate web application. The app allows users to explore and create property listings. The goal is to automate development, testing, and deployment using DevOps tools.

Ubuntu will be used as the main environment for development and Devops implementation.

## Stack

The application is structured as follows:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (Tailwinds css for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu

## Setup Plan

- Dockerfiles will be created for both frontend and backend.
- Environment files for development, test, and production.
- GitHub Actions to handle testing and building the app automatically.

## Environments

- Development
- Test: Automated testing through GitHub Actions
- Production: Automated deployment to (Railway or Vercel) I am still viguring out which one to choose.

## Why These Tools

- React and Node.js: I am familiar with this javascript stack.
- PostgreSQL: Tried it in a previous project and want to learn it more through the implementation process.
- Docker: enables reproducibility.
- GitHub Actions: for Automation and CI/CD.
- Ubuntu: provides a Linux environment for development and testing (I will install it as dual-boot with my windows OS).

## Learning Goals

My motivation to build a foundational DevOps skills. As a software developer I find it very interesting and important to learn this skill.  
My goal is to learn:

- Using Docker
- Automating testing and deployment with GitHub Actions
- Managing Docker Compose
- Structuring a professional project that saves time in the development process and in the future.
